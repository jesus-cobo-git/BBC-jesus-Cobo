      <h2>Musk‚Äôs empire risks being targeted by EU for potential X fines</h2>
      <h1>The EU‚Äôs enforcement arm, the European Commission, is contemplating this approach because Musk‚Äôs 
        influence across multiple companies is seen as central to his decision-making on X, making his other businesses potentially relevant for calculating penalties.
        The fines, if extended to Musk‚Äôs broader business empire, could amplify the financial impact substantially, as X alone would face a much smaller penalty than his 
        entire portfolio would. However, Tesla, being publicly traded, is expected to remain exempt from these calculations.

        but did not secure enough seats to govern independently, leaving room for potential coalition negotiations with the far-right
         Vox or smaller regional parties. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez‚Äôs Socialist Party (PSOE) may explore alliances with other 
         left-wing groups and regional parties to retain power.
